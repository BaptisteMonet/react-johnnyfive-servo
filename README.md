# React and Johnny-Five Traffic Lights

A simple project involving the use of Johnny-Five and React to control a set of lights, using actions and functions to control and animate them. This is an (imperfect) creation I'm releasing. This is actually the first project I made that makes use of JavaScript to make an IoT application.

## Circuit

The circuit is very simple for this â€” it consists of 3 LEDs (red, yellow, and green) to act like a set of traffic lights.

### List of components

* 3 LEDs (1 red, 1 yellow, 1 green)
* 3 220Ohm Resistors
* 3 coloured jumper cables
* 5 black jumper cables

## Installing

You can use NPM or Yarn to install and use the application, though I recommend yarn, it's pretty good for dependency management.

You can do `npm install` or `yarn install` to download all the app's dependencies.
