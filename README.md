## Installing

You can use NPM or Yarn to install and use the application, though I recommend yarn, it's pretty good for dependency management.

You can do `npm install` or `yarn install` to download all the app's dependencies.

## Commands

There are various commands you can use to work the app, from building, to development, to testing. Again, you can use Yarn or NPM to run the app.

### List of Commands

* `start` — Start the app Server (note: run `build` first!)
* `build` — Build the app for a production environment
* `dev-start` — Start the app server under the development environment
* `dev-server` — Runs the Webpack development server for the client-side React app
* `styles` — Build the Application styles (uses PostCSS)
* `test` — Runs ESlint and Flow to check the code for issues.
